1.0	Introduction
--------------------

This is 'living documentation' because by the time I 'finish' it, Facebook will
probably have yet another layout change, requiring a whole heap of changes.
Still, it is essential to have this documentation, as without it, the addon will
become an unmaintainable mess of hacks upon hacks to patch up new layouts.

What makes downloading Facebook albums harder than it appears is that while the
UI probably has great internal documentation for the developers, from an
external perspective it's both confusing and vastly inconsistent.

For example, the Photos UI for people, pages and groups are all completely
different from one another. The UI for groups is the oldest, which all photos
UIs used to be pre-Timeline-update. Then, the Timeline update rolled out, and
people and pages got this brand new interface, but groups didn't get updated.

Finally, in early 2013, another update arrived, but only people were affected.
Now we have people on the 'v3' UI, pages on the 'v2' UI and groups on 'v1'.

There are more minute factors that fragment the algorithms for this addon even
further. Somehow, even after Facebook appeared to force everyone to have a
username by assigning them automatically where missing, a small minority still
don't have alphanumeric usernames. The URL formats for those with and without
usernames are completely different.

Great.

2.0	Definitions
-------------------

2.1	Terms
-------------

USER		The client that is interacting with the browser.

PAGE		Any document that can be viewed in a browser (compare EGAP).

CURRENT PAGE	The page which the interactive user's browser is viewing.

PERSON		The account for a human on Facebook.

EGAP		An organisation or thing which can be 'liked' (compare PAGE).

SPECIAL ALBUM	An ALBUM which contains 'Photos of' or 'Photos [by]' a TARGET.

GENERIC ALBUM	An ALBUM which is not a SPECIAL ALBUM.

ELIGIBLE PAGE	The primary PAGE of a TARGET. Not a PAGE for the TARGET's
		ALBUMLIST, ALBUM, post, photo, video, details, etc.

WORDIFIER	The alphanumeric identifier for a TARGET that appears in URLs.

PMAGIC		The magic number '2305272732', used in URLs for SPECIAL ALBUMS.

2.2	Kinds of PAGES
----------------------

(A)	GENERIC ALBUM
(B)	SPECIAL ALBUM: 'Photos [by]' a TARGET
(E)	EGAP
(G)	GROUP
(H)	PERSON
(L)	list of ALBUMS
(O)	SPECIAL ALBUM: 'Photos of' a TARGET
(P)	individual photo
(V)	individual video

3.0	Download workflow
-------------------------

1.	USER browses to the primary PAGE of a TARGET.
2.	USER activates the addon using their browser's context menu.
3.	USER chooses one or more ALBUMS to download from the TARGET.

4.0	Detecting the ELIGIBLE PAGE
-----------------------------------

Good design and Mozilla's review process dictates that the context menu option
for download invocation should only be made visible on a relevant PAGE. After
all, it is a *context* menu.

If the URL of the CURRENT PAGE has path 'profile.php' and a query parameter
matching 'id=(\d+)', then the PAGE is an ELIGIBLE PAGE, and the TARGET is a
PERSON that has no WORDIFIER.

If the URL of the CURRENT PAGE has path matching
'pages\/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)\/(\d+)', then the PAGE is an ELIGIBLE PAGE, and the
TARGET is an EGAP that has no WORDIFIER.

If the URL of the CURRENT PAGE has path matching 'groups\/(\d+)\/', then the
PAGE is an ELIGIBLE PAGE, and the TARGET is a GROUP that has no WORDIFIER.

If the URL of the CURRENT PAGE has path matching 'groups\/([A-Za-z0-9.]{5,})\/'
but does not match 'groups\/(\d+)\/', then the PAGE is an ELIGIBLE PAGE, and the
TARGET is a GROUP with a WORDIFIER.

If the URL of the CURRENT PAGE has path matching '([A-Za-z0-9.]{5,})', then the
PAGE could be an ELIGIBLE PAGE, and if so, the TARGET could be a PERSON or EGAP
with a WORDIFIER.

This situation can be disambiguated by checking for the presence of:

*	#timelineHeadlineLikeButton: guaranteed ELIGIBLE PAGE, TARGET is an EGAP
*	div.profileHeaderButton.FriendButton: ELIGIBLE PAGE, TARGET is a PERSON

Otherwise, the CURRENT PAGE is not an ELIGIBLE PAGE.

5.0	Building the URL for the TARGET's ALBUMLIST
---------------------------------------------------

When the USER initiates a download on an ELIGIBLE PAGE, the URL of the TARGET's
ALBUMLIST needs to be generated so that it can later be fetched.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORDIFIER | TARGET | * | Output URL for ALBUMLIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Y         | PERSON | 1 | /WORDIFIER/photos_albums
Y         | EGAP   |   | /WORDIFIER/photos_albums
Y         | GROUP  |   | /groups/WORDIFIER/photos/
N         | PERSON | 2 | /profile.php?id=NUMIFIER&sk=photos_albums
N         | EGAP   | 3 | /pages/x/NUMIFIER?sk=photos_albums
N         | GROUP  |   | /groups/NUMIFIER/photos/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	This is now '/WORDIFIER/photos?collection_token=NUMIFIER:PMAGIC:6' but
	thankfully the old syntax works. Otherwise we would have to find out the
	PERSON's NUMIFIER, which appears to be difficult.

2.	This is now '...&sk=photos&collection_token=NUMIFIER:PMAGIC:6' but the
	old syntax still works. We know the NUMIFIER, so this syntax is not more
	difficult to generate, but it's longer so we prefer the old.

3.	The 'x' is the hyphenated 'SEO-friendly' component generated from the
	EGAP's HUMANIFIER. Thankfully anything is accepted here, so we don't
	have to find it out.

6.0	Populating available ALBUMS
-----------------------------------

Once the ALBUMLIST URL has been generated, and the ALBUMLIST has been fetched,
it needs to be parsed for ALBUMS available for download.

For SPECIAL ALBUMS, check for the presence of links to (O) and (B) albums with
the method as follows:

---------------------------
TARGET | Checks to execute
---------------------------
PERSON | 1, 2
EGAP   | 3, 4
GROUP  | 5
---------------------------

1.	Check for an 'a' element with its 'aria-controls' matching
	'pagelet_timeline_app_collection_NUMIFIER:PMAGIC:4'. If it exists, add
	an album named 'Photos of HUMANIFIER', with the URL being:
	*	'/WORDIFIER/photos' if the TARGET has a WORDIFIER
	*	'/profile.php?id=NUMIFIER&sk=photos' otherwise

2.	Check for an 'a' element with its 'aria-controls' matching
	'pagelet_timeline_app_collection_NUMIFIER:PMAGIC:5'. If it exists, add
	an album named 'Photos by HUMANIFIER', with the URL being:
	*	'/WORDIFIER/photos_stream' if the TARGET has a WORDIFIER
	*	'/profile.php?id=NUMIFIER&sk=photos_stream' otherwise

3.	Check for an 'a.fbPhotosRedesignNavContent' element with an indirect
	'i' descendant containing class 'sx_859619' (this is a sprite key). If
	it exists, add an album named 'Photos of HUMANIFIER', with the URL
	being:
	*	'/WORDIFIER/photos' if the TARGET has a WORDIFIER
	*	'/pages/x/NUMIFIER?sk=photos' otherwise

4.	Check for an 'a.fbPhotosRedesignNavContent' element with an indirect
	'i' descendant containing class 'sx_511ed3' (this is a sprite key). If
	it exists, add an album named 'Photos by HUMANIFIER', with the URL
	being:
	*	'/WORDIFIER/photos_stream' if the TARGET has a WORDIFIER
	*	'/pages/x/NUMIFIER?sk=photos_stream' otherwise

5.	The ALBUMLIST of a GROUP also happens to be the ALBUM of 'Photos by', so
	add an album named 'Photos by HUMANIFIER', with the URL being:
	*	'/groups/WORDIFIER/photos/' if the TARGET has a WORDIFIER
	*	'/groups/NUMIFIER/photos/' otherwise

For GENERIC ALBUMS, check for the presence of (A) albums with the method as
follows:

---------------------------
TARGET | Checks to execute
---------------------------
PERSON | 1
EGAP   | 1
GROUP  | 2
---------------------------

1.	Select all elements matching 'a.albumThumbLink'. For each of these, add
	an album with the URL equal to the element's 'href' attribute. Then,
	traverse to the element's parent, and find the descendant matching
	'a.photoTextTitle strong'. The content of this element is the title.

2.	The same process as in check #1, but the initial selector should be
	'a.uiMediaThumbAlb' instead of 'a.albumThumbLink'.

7.0	Fetching photos and videos for an ALBUM
-----------------------------------------------

7.1	Photos
--------------

In all ALBUMS, simply select all elements matching the selector
'a.uiMediaThumb:not(.uiMediaThumbAlb)'. The 'ajaxify' attribute of each element
will contain a query parameter, 'src', which is the URL for the high-resolution
image file.

7.2	Videos
--------------

Videos are a little more difficult. Select all elements matching 'a.uiVideoLink'
to get their 'href' attributes, which contain the URLs of video pages.

For each of these URLs, fetch their sources, then match against the regular
expression: \u002522hd_src\u002522\u00253A\u002522.+?\u002522

Something like this will remain:

\u002522hd_src\u002522\u00253A\u002522https\u00253A\u00255C\u00252F\u00255C\u002
52Ffbcdn-video-x.akamaihd.net\u00255C\u00252Fxxx-xx-xxxx\u00255C\u00252Fx\u00255
C\u00252Fxxxxxx\u00255C\u00252Fx\u00255C\u00252Fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx.mp4\u00253
Foh\u00253Dxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\u002526oe\u00253Dxxxxxxxx\u002526__g
da__\u00253Dxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\u002522

You will be amazed at the amount of unwrapping we'll have to go through.

1.	Resolve the Unicode backslash escapes. eval() is dumb and unsafe, so
	we'll use JSON.parse() instead: s = JSON.parse('"' + s + '"');

%22hd_src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ffbcdn-video-x.akamaihd.net%5C%2Fxxx-xx-xxx
x%5C%2Fx%5C%2Fxxxxxx%5C%2Fx%5C%2Fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx.mp4%3Foh%3Dxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%26oe%3Dxxxxxxxx%26__gda__%3Dxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxx%22

2.	Then run decodeURIComponent() over it: s = decodeURIComponent(s);

"hd_src":"https:\/\/fbcdn-video-x.akamaihd.net\/xxx-xx-xxxx\/x\/xxxxxx\/x\/xxxxx
xxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx.mp4?oh=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&oe=xxxxxxxx&__gda__=xxx
xxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

3.	Hey, that's starting to look familiar now. More JSON, so let's treat it
	like an object and parse: s = JSON.parse('{' + s + '}').hd_src;

https://fbcdn-video-x.akamaihd.net/xxx-xx-xxxx/x/xxxxxx/x/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx.
mp4?oh=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&oe=xxxxxxxx&__gda__=xxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
