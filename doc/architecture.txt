1.0	Introduction
--------------------

Version 3 marks a change from being implemented directly as an XUL extension to
utilising Mozilla's new Add-on SDK. This provides a number of benefits,
including faster development and review, better API documentation and the
extension being restartless without any additional effort, while retaining
access to XPCOM where required (e.g. for local filesystem I/O).

For the purposes of security and a future multi-process Firefox, the SDK
requires that extension code is separated between 'add-on code' in lib/ and
'content scripts' in data/, the latter being used to interact with the extension
UI (panel) and pages (page-worker). Add-on code and content scripts interact via
messages (postMessage/self.on('message')) or port events (port.emit/port.on).

The extension uses port events over messages where possible, for two reasons:

*	Extensibility: each event requires a name in addition to the payload.
*	Timing: port events are queued until despatch, but messages create a
	race condition; they fail if posted before the receiver is ready.

Please refer to any relevant terms in section 2.0, Definitions, of facebook.txt.

2.0	Files
-------------

Source files must have unique names, even across directories. Try to stick to
lowercase alphabet and numerals only; avoid capital letters and underscores.

2.1	Main code (lib/)
------------------------

*	main.js		Bootstraps the extension and UI, and handles events.
*	ui.js		Sets up and interacts with panels, widgets, etc.
*	target.js	Request class that queries the current tab for a TARGET.
*	albumlist.js	Request class that queries an ALBUMLIST for ALBUMS.
*	album.js	Request class that queries an ALBUM for MEDIA.
*	download.js	Download manager class.
*	dlhelpers.js	Internal utilities for use by download.js.

2.2	Panel code (data/content/panel/js/)
-------------------------------------------

*	panel.js	Primary UI code for data/content/panel/html/ui.html.

2.3	Engine code (data/content/engine/)
------------------------------------------

*	twtarget.js	Tab worker for target.js.
*	pwalbumlist.js	Page worker for albumlist.js.
*	pwalbum.js	Page worker for album.js: getting album info.
*	pwmedium.js	Page worker for album.js: dereferencing indirect media.

2.4	Shared library code (lib/shared.js)
-------------------------------------------

This file contains common utilities that can be accessed from both main library
code as well as content scripts and workers.

To load the module from main code:

	var lib_shared = require('./shared');

To attach the module to a worker:

	..., contentScriptFile: sdk_data.url('../lib/shared.js'), ...

The shared module is structured unusually compared to other code because it
needs to be valid and available in multiple dissimilar contexts.

3.0	Module relationships and communication
----------------------------------------------

Avoid anonymous callback and handler functions, they are hard to read and cause
unwieldy levels of indentation.

Try to log a short message in emission, handler and callback functions where
possible to track data flow. Don't do this for any communications relating to
logging, or you will generate unnecessary noise and/or cause an infinite loop.

3.1	Port events
-------------------

Events are used strictly in a request/response format, though responses are
not required for all situations.

To improve code clarity, all port event names conform to the format:

	(CLIENT)/(SERVER)/(request|response)/(NAME)

Functions that emit port events have names of the format:

	emit_(REMOTE)_(request|response)_(NAME)

Functions that handle received port events have names of the format:

	handle_(REMOTE)_(request|response)_(NAME)

REMOTE is the 'other' module, be it CLIENT or SERVER.

For example, when panel.js requests an ALBUMLIST from ui.js:

1.	In the file		panel.js
	the function		emit_ui_request_albumlist
	sends the event 	panel/ui/request/albumlist

2.	In the file		ui.js
	the function		handle_panel_request_albumlist
	receives the event	panel/ui/request/albumlist

3.	In the file		ui.js
	the function		emit_panel_response_albumlist
	sends the event		panel/ui/response/albumlist

4.	In the file		panel.js
	the function		handle_ui_response_albumlist

3.1	Callbacks
-----------------

For asynchronous processes that do not cross contexts, callbacks are used. For
clarity, all callbacks are named with the format:

	callback_(NAME)

4.0	Modules and libraries
-----------------------------

When requiring a module, name the variable sdk_(NAME) if the module comes from
the Add-on SDK, or lib_(NAME) if the module is local to this extension.
