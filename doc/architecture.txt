1.0	Introduction
--------------------

Version 3 marks a change from being implemented directly as an XUL extension to
utilising Mozilla's new Add-on SDK. This provides a number of benefits,
including faster development and review, better API documentation and the
extension being restartless without any additional effort, while retaining
access to XPCOM where required (e.g. for local filesystem I/O).

For the purposes of security and a future multi-process Firefox, the SDK
requires that extension code is separated between 'add-on code' in lib/ and
'content scripts' in data/, the latter being used to interact with the extension
UI (panel) and pages (page-worker). Add-on code and content scripts interact via
messages (postMessage/self.on('message')) or port events (port.emit/port.on).

The extension uses port events over messages where possible, for two reasons:

*	Extensibility: each event requires a name in addition to the payload.
*	Timing: port events are queued until despatch, but messages create a
	race condition; they fail if posted before the receiver is ready.

2.0	Files
-------------

2.1	Main code (lib/)
------------------------

*	albumlist.js	Fetches available albums.
*	log.js		Common logging and debugging facilities for main code.
*	main.js		Bootstraps the extension and UI, and handles events.

2.2	Panel code (data/content/panel/js/)
-------------------------------------------

*	ui.js		Primary UI code for data/content/panel/html/ui.html

2.3	Engine code (data/content/engine/)
------------------------------------------

*	alworker.js	Page worker for albumlist.js.
*	eligible.js	Tells main.js if the current tab has an eligible page.
